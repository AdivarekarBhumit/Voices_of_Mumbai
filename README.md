# Voice_of_Mumbai
Often time, we come across various problem on the streets of Mumbai, but we are clueless as to where to report the same. So, your task is to create a portal for the same, where citizens can report their problems, and others can view, vote and comment on the same, with respect to the status of the problem, whether it is resolved, ongoing, or gotten worse. Apart from that, users can mark locations as well on the map, where they encountered the problem. 

● Lodging problems and gauge their severity or distance
● Vote, comment and view problems according to severity or distance
● Mark locations on the map, where the problem was faced, extract the ward that problem belongs to, report to the ward
